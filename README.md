_To Mrs. Saville, England._


St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17â€”.


You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking.

I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.

```

* Change hyperparameters

eg. 
``` 
max_new_tkns = 1000 # generated text length 
```

* set `filename` as input text

eg.
``` 
filename = 'frankenstein.txt' # set as input text 
```

* Set gpt model

eg.
``` 
enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o") # change gpt model 
```

* Generated text file created and placed in same folder as `gptopus.py`,
generated text file will use input filename inserting `_out.txt`

eg. `frankenstein_out.txt`
```
